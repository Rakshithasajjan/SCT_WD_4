ToDo Dashboard is a clean, animated task manager with dark/light theme support.

It features three key sections: Today’s Tasks, Tomorrow’s Plan, and Task History.

Theme Switcher:

A toggle lets users switch between light and dark modes, adjusting background, card, and accent colors smoothly.

Date Card:

Displays the current day, date, and month using a vibrant circular design, animated with a slide-down effect on load.

Task Management:

Today’s Tasks:

Users can add tasks via an input and "+" button. Tasks are draggable to reorder and clickable to mark as complete (strikethrough with opacity).

Tomorrow’s Plan:

After finishing today’s tasks, a new section slides in allowing task planning for the next day.

Progress Bar:

A yellow progress bar fills based on completed tasks, updating in real time.

Task History:

When users finish the day, today's tasks move into a "Task History" section, displayed with faded style and a gray accent.

Animations:

Smooth fadeIn, slideDown, pulse, and bounce animations are used across cards, buttons, and tasks to enhance user experience.

Drag and Drop:

Tasks can be reordered by dragging; functionality is built using simple dragstart, dragover, and drop listeners.

Local Storage:

Tasks, tomorrow's plan, and history persist even after page reloads by saving data in the browser’s local storage.

Responsive Design:

Mobile-friendly with fluid sizing and flexible layouts.
